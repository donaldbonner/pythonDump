Quick Server
============

This is a python program wrote in 2.7.5.  This uses the python SimpleHTTPServer protocol.  This can be run directly from terminal using 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000' with the same behavior.  Writing this lets me print off the inet server name to log onto for ease of use.  

The installServer.sh is only used to set permissions of they are not set correctly and then copy the files to their neccessary place on the filesystem to be called from terminal.

**Python 2.7.5**
