This is a script for the common prank of CatFacts!  The idea is to run the script to annoy your friends.  There will be a file input with a list of all the different cat facts!  Every three cat facts there will be a prompt to quit the service.  The code to quit the service will of course be a random string that is impossible to repeat.  

On a real note, this will check a mail account to respond accordingly to a person trying to cancel the CatFacts!  The text service in the parent folder will also be taken advantage of.  Hopefully your friends will love it!
